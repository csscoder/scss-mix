# MIX by CSSCODER

<h3> <a href="http://mix.csscoder.pro/" target="_blank">MIX.CSSCODER.PRO</a> </h3>

Hey guys! My name is Aleksandr. Already more than ten years, I help to developer teams and individual people to create sites. My specialization is front-end development. And now, I want to share the mixins/functions collection. Some mixins I coded myself, some I upgraded, some just copy.  I hope the solutions will be helpful to you.

## Installation

For using mixins, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csscoderRU/scss-mix/master/src/csscoder-lib/_csscoder-lib.scss" target="_blank">download file</a> to your project sources folder and importing ```_csscoder-lib.scss``` file to your main SCSS file. This file you can see <a href="https://github.com/csscoderRU/scss-mix/blob/master/src/csscoder-lib/_csscoder-lib.scss" target="_blank">here</a>

```scss
// It can be looks like this
@import "_csscoder-lib.scss";
```

After that, you can use my collection of mixins and functions. About each, you can read In the relevant sections.
